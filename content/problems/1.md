## Problem

Find the sum of all the numbers evenly divisible by 3 or 5 below 1000.

## General solution

Given the small search space, the simplest solution is to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 999 and add them to a running total if they are evenly divisible by 3 or 5.

## Solution: Go

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var sum int = 0
	
	for num := 1; num < 1000; num++ {
		if num % 3 == 0 || num % 5 == 0 {
			sum += num
		}
	}

	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
